					<h1 class="title">The Curious Case of the Musks</h1>
	
					<h3><i>Tesla founder Elon Musk and his father Errol Musk are both on a baby-making spree.</i></As></h3>

					<p>Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is one man with many businesses, lovers and children. After going through three divorces with two women, he started becoming a serial monogamist of sorts – or so we thought, until the world found out about his <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-shivon-zilis-secret-twins-neuralink-tesla" target=”_blank”>secret twins</a> with his Neuralink employee Shivon Zilis recently.</p>

					<p>The twins arrived last November - just a month before his second child with Canadian singer Grimes, his on-off lover, was born through surrogacy. He’s also seen romancing Australian actress Natasha Bussett early this year, raising speculation that he could have been two- or three-timing at some point in time.</p>

					<p>But given that he’s not married to these women, he’s safe from accusations of infidelity. And if his lovers are aware of his concurrent intimacies with others and raise no objection, he could even argue that he’s simply a polyamorist.</p>

					<p>According to definitions on the <a href="https://polyamorylegal.org/faqs", target="_blank">Polyamory Legal Advocacy Coalition website</a>, “people engaged in polyamory can be involved in one relationship with multiple partners or in multiple one-on-one relationships”. What makes polyamory different from cheating or betrayal is that everything is above board, and all partners involved are agreeable to the arrangement.</p>
						
					<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/polyamory-relationships-how-common-is-non-monogamy-cbsn-originals/?intcid=CNM-00-10abd1h", target="_blank">CBS News</a> reported in 2019 that 4% to 5% of US residents are having polyamorous relationships. A number of such couples or throuples were featured in its documentary.</p>
					
					<p>Organizations like PLAC have been calling for more legal recognition for such non-traditional but consensual relationships. Their argument is: polyamorists should not be subjected to discrimination and humiliation on the basis of their lifestyle choices. Their position might have gained some ground. Two cities in <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/somerville-massachusetts-recognizes-polyamorous-relationships/", target="_blank">Massachusetts</a> have revised their ordinance to officially recognise polyamory in the last two years.</p>

					<p>Interestingly, there also appears to be growing social acceptance for polygamy, the marriage between more than two partners, according to longitudinal findings in <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/313112/understanding-increase-moral-acceptability-polygamy.aspx", target="_blank">Gallup’s Values and Beliefs poll</a>. This is despite the fact that polygamy is still outlawed in all 50 states of America, including Utah, which is home to more than two million Mormons.</p>

					<p>In many parts of the world, polygamy is in fact legal when certain conditions are met. Many Muslim-majority countries in Southeast Asia, Middle East and Africa recognize polygamy among Muslims, especially when the man is able to secure the consent of his first wife. In general, polygyny (the marriage between a man and multiple women) is more accepted than polyandry (the marriage between a woman and multiple men).</p>

					<p>While Elon Musk never fails to set tongues wagging, his 76-year-old father, Errol Musk, turned out to be even more of a headline grabber. Just last week, the elder Musk scandalized the world again when he announced the arrival of his second love child with stepdaughter Jana Bezuidenhout, who’s 42 years his junior.</p> 

					<p>Errol and Jana had their first child in 2018. While they are not biologically related, he helped raise her since she was four, after he married her mother Heide Bezuidenhout. Jana grew up alongside Elon and other step-siblings for many years before Errol and Heide headed for divorce.</p>


					<div class="flourish-embed flourish-network" data-src="visualisation/10690780"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
					</div>

					<p>If Errol is still married to Heide when he has a sexual relationship with Jana, he could have gotten into trouble with the law. In 2016, a man in South Africa - where the elder Musk reportedly lives - was <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/sex-with-stepdaughter-still-incest-high-court-rules-a7309691.html", target="_blank">sentenced to life</a> for having sex with his stepdaughter while still married to her mother. In the eyes of the Nairobi court, the man was guilty under incest laws although he’s not genetically linked to his stepdaughter.</p>

					<p>The case of Errol is more debatable, as he’s technically no longer a stepfather to Jana before becoming her lover and the father of their children.</p>
					
					<p>In the US, incest laws vary from state to state, with some banning all incestuous relationships while others banning only incestuous marriages. The age of the participants is also taken into account when the legality of their relationship is weighed.</p>

					<p>Around the world, although incest is both a social taboo and legal offence, there are also many countries that tolerate incest between consenting adults, distantly-related adults or same-sex adults. Most will stop short of allowing incest between an adult parent/grandparent and a minor though, as the question of sexual grooming and exploitation comes into play.</p>
