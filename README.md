**The Curious Case of the Musks**

This is a project inspired by the surprise baby news from tech mogul Elon Musk and his father Errol Musk. 

The younger Musk grabbed headlines when he's found to have fathered a set of twins with a Neuralink employee, while the elder Musk announced shortly after that he's welcomed his second love child with a stepdaughter from his last marriage.

There are two family maps showing the father-son duo's expanding clans. Both are made with Flourish (for now). 

The story also explores whether Elon Musk has potentially breached polygamy laws in the US, and whether Errol Musk has violated incest laws in South Africa - based on what is made known to the public so far.

An interactive button is built in with D3 codes to allow readers to find out whether polygamy and incest are legal / tolerated in their countries. 

The data sets on polygamy and incest are from World Population Review. Both include about 80 countries in the lists.
